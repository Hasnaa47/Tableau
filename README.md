# Tableau
This Tableau project analyzes vehicle maintenance data to identify servicing needs based on mileage, condition, usage, and fuel type. An interactive dashboard highlights key patterns and shows that high-mileage and poorly maintained vehicles require more frequent servicing, supporting better maintenance planning and decisions.
